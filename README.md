Technothlon’19 E’nigme de Confiance 

Trust is an important factor for prosperity of any civilization.  Again, of course it is the root of all evil.  The strong do overpower the weak and civilization progresses with all exploiters, or wait, does it? Can ‘cooperation and understanding’ of the innocents, prevail over those who cheat? Based on the concept of prisoner’s dilemma, this game tested the ability of the participants to understand and predict their moves to choose the type of character that would reign in the race of evolution. To add to the fun, there was a good amount of mathematics and statistics involved, to test the ability of the young champs at the MAINS event. And ‘trust’ us (rest assured you can) it was a lot of fun as well!
